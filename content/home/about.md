## Understanding Linkages Between Human Behavior and Water Resources 

My research integrates the biophysical, socioeconomic, and political components of human water use to inform sustainable water management. I use satellite remote sensing and economic data to drive physical models of human-water systems, including agricultural and urban water uses. These systems models are then used to understand human water use, governance, and the associated impacts on water resources.
